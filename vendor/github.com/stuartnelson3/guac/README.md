guac
====

guac watches a directory tree for changes and executes a function whenever a file is added, removed, or modified.


## use

create a go program that imports guac and any of the guac packages you want (or your own arbitrary callback).

check out the examples folder for an example that concatenates all css and js files into single `application.css` and `application.js` files.
